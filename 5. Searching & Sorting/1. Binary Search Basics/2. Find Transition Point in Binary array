Given a sorted array containing only 0s and 1s, find the transition point. 




int transitionPoint(int arr[], int n) {
    // code here
    int l = 0, r = n-1;
    int ans = -1;
    while(l<=r)
    {
        int mid = (l+r)/2;
        if(arr[mid] == 0)
            l = mid+1;
        else{
            r = mid-1;
            ans = mid;
        }    
    }
    
    return ans; // or r also bcoz both are same
}
