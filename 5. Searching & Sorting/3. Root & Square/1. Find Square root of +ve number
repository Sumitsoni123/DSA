Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.


class Solution {
public:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        
        int l=0, r = x, ans = -1;
        
        while(l<=r) {
            int mid = l+(r-l)/2;
            
            if(sqrt(x) == mid)
                return mid;
            else if(sqrt(x) > mid) {
                ans = mid;
                l = mid+1;
            }
            else
                r = mid-1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
