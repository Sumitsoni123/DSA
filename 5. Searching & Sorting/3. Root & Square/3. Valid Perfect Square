Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt.



class Solution {
public:
    int sqrRoot(int num) {

        int l = 0, r = num, ans;
        
        while(l <= r)
        {
            int mid = l+(r-l)/2;
            if(sqrt(num) == mid)
                return mid;
            
            else if(sqrt(num) < mid)
                r = mid-1;
            else {
                ans = mid;
                l = mid+1;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
    
    bool isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        
        int sqr = sqrRoot(num);
        
        return (sqr == sqrt(num))? true: false;    
    }
};
