Given an array A[ ] of positive integers of size N, where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are M students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among M students such that :
1. Each student gets exactly one packet.
2. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student is minimum.




// TC- (NlongN + N)

    public:
    long long findMinDiff(vector<long long> a, long long n, long long m) {
        //code
        long long r = m-1, l;
        sort(a.begin(), a.end());
        long long mn = INT_MAX;
        
        while(r < a.size())
        {
            l = r-(m-1);
            long long diff = a[r] - a[l];
            mn = min(mn, diff);
            r++;
        }
        
        return mn;
