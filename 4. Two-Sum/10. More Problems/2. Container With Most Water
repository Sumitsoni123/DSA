You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        
        int maxArea = 0, l = 0, r = height.size()-1;
        
        while(l < r)
        {
            int h = min(height[l], height[r]);
            int w = (r-l);
            
            maxArea = max(h*w, maxArea);
            (height[l] < height[r])? l++ : r--;
        }
        
        return maxArea;
    }
