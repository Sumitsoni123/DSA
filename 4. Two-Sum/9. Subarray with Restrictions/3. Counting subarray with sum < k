Given an array A of N non-negative numbers and you are also given non-negative number B.

You need to find the number of subarrays in A having sum less than B. We may assume that there is no overflow.



public class Solution {
    public int solve(int[] arr, int k)
    {
        int left = 0, cnt = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        for(int right=0; right<arr.length; right++)
        {
            sum += arr[right];
            while(sum >=k)
            {
                sum -= arr[left];
                left++;
            }
            cnt += (right - left+1);
        }

        return cnt;
    }
}
